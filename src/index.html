                        The world is ever changing. But how can change be brought about effectively? How can certain aims be realised? Public Policies and Institutions are the tools we can use to make the world a better place. Oxenu contributes to this end - from problem assessment via strategic planning to the formulation of solutions for implementation.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Public Policy and Institutions</h3>
                    <p>
                        Oxenu offers solutions for the entire policy process. The first step towards improving our lives is to understand how the world works: Our team of scientists and practitioners is highly experienced in providing problem assessment analyses. Changing the world also requires a deeper understanding of how both public and private actors can influence the political process. We develop individual solutions based on the particular context and needs. Scientific analyses sometimes leave NGOs and governmental actors with little more than abstract conclusions. We at Oxenu value a holistic approach: what we offer is comprehensive services, while always keeping the next step in mind to help you achieve your goals.

                    <p>
                        Human rights and international law have become indispensable aspects of any public or private project. But well beyond the public sphere, compliance with international human rights standards is key for corporations in the 21st century. Apart from allowing entrepreneurs to fulfill their responsibilities, it allows companies to enhance their reputation and create amiable relations to both the public sector as well as the general public. Building on substantial expertise is the fields of human rights research and public sector consulting, Oxenu offers tailored solutions for strategic decisions in compliance with international human rights law for both private and public clients, whether governmental or not.

                    <h3>Political Risk and Legal Framework Analysis</h3>
                    <p>
                        Political risk such as armed conflicts or climate change-related dangers are a significant threat to private sector activities as well as to the work of non-governmental actors. Building on extensive academic expertise in the field of conflict research, we offer tailored predictions about risk factors in different countries providing empirical evidence for complex investment decisions. In addition, our team of experienced lawyers analyses the legal framework in host countries of non-governmental activities.

                        Political risk such as armed conflicts or climate change-related dangers are a significant threat to private sector activities as well as to the work of non-governmental actors. Building on extensive academic expertise in the field of conflict research, we offer tailored predictions about risk factors in different countries providing empirical evidence for complex investment decisions. In addition, our team of experienced lawyers analyses the legal framework in host countries of non-governmental activities.
